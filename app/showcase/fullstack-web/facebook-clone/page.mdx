Social media platforms are an essential part of modern web applications, and in this project, I set out to **explore and experiment with Firebase’s suite of tools** by building a **Facebook Clone**. This web application leverages **Firebase Authentication, Firestore (NoSQL database), and Cloud Storage**, offering a **real-time, interactive experience** similar to the functionality of major social media platforms.

## **Why Firebase?**

Firebase is a powerful **backend-as-a-service (BaaS)** that simplifies development by providing essential cloud-based functionalities. In this project, I focused on utilizing Firebase’s features to enable **authentication, data storage, real-time updates, and media handling** without managing a traditional backend.

## **Key Features**

🔥 **Real-Time Feed** – Instantly updates with new posts, likes, and comments.  
✍️ **Post Creation** – Users can create posts with text and images.  
❤️ **Like & Comment** – Engage with posts via likes and comments.  
🔗 **Share Posts** – Allow users to reshare content.  
📝 **Edit Profile** – Customize user profiles.  
🔍 **Search & Add Users** – Find and connect with other users.  
🌙 **Dark / Light Mode** – Toggle between themes for a better UX.

## **Tech Stack**

This project integrates several key technologies to deliver a seamless experience:

**📚 Core Packages**

- **firebase** – Authentication, Firestore for NoSQL data storage, image uploads, and hosting.
- **styled-components** – Component-based styling for a sleek UI.
- **react-router-dom** – Routing and navigation management.

**🔧 Additional Tools**

- **React Hooks** – State and effect management.
- **Context API** – Centralized state for authentication and themes.
- **Cloud Firestore** – Real-time database functionality.

## **User Experience & Design**

To maintain familiarity while adding a modern touch, I implemented **styled components** for UI elements like **modals, dropdowns, and interactive buttons**—keeping in line with Facebook’s design principles while ensuring a **minimalist, clean layout**.

## **What I Learned**

This project was a deep dive into **Firebase’s ecosystem**, helping me gain experience with:

- **Real-time database operations** and handling live updates efficiently.
- **Managing authentication flows** (login, signup, session persistence).
- **Cloud Storage for media uploads** and optimizing image handling.
- **Enhancing UI/UX with styled-components** while keeping performance in check.
