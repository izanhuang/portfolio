# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Izan**

A **self-taught Software Engineer** with a **Bachelor of Science in Information Systems** from **Stony Brook University**.

With **3.5 years of experience** in **frontend development** across multiple companies, I specialize in:

- ðŸš€ **Building seamless and user-friendly web applications**
- ðŸŽ¨ **Crafting intuitive interfaces** that enhance user experience and functionality

## **My Journey**

From **self-learning** to **large-scale enterprise applications**, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in **modern frontend technologies**.

### **Recent Project: Dooble**

I developed **Dooble**, a **simple drawing web app** that provides **daily drawing prompts** to help users get creative.  
This solo project allowed me to experiment with:

- âœ… **HTML5 Canvas API for drawing**
- âœ… **React for frontend development**
- âœ… **Vercel for seamless deployment**
- âœ… **Cursor: AI Code Editor** to speed up the development process

I used **Cursor** as an AI code editor to assist in writing and enhancing my code. It helped me stay productive and focus on building features while learning about the power of AI-assisted development.

Iâ€™m passionate about:

- ðŸ’¡ **Technologyâ€™s impact on daily life**
