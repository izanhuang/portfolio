# **Introduction**

Hi, I’m Izan, a self-taught Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from Stony Brook University. With 3.5 years of experience in frontend development across multiple companies, I specialize in building seamless and user-friendly web applications. My passion lies in crafting intuitive interfaces that enhance user experience and functionality.

From my early days of self-learning to working on large-scale enterprise applications, I have continuously honed my skills in modern frontend technologies. Most recently, I embarked on a solo project, developing an AI-powered web application called SAI, designed to provide personalized self-improvement advice. This project has allowed me to deepen my expertise in React, state management, and AI-driven UI interactions.

Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in technology’s impact on daily life, personal development, and creating tools that empower users. I’m always open to new challenges and opportunities that allow me to push the boundaries of what’s possible in web development.

Let’s connect and build something great!
