# **Welcome to My Blog â€“ A New Chapter ðŸš€**

Hey everyone, and welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹

If youâ€™re new here (which you probably are since this is my first post), Iâ€™m Izanâ€”**a self-taught software engineer, content creator, and lifelong learner.** I graduated from **Stony Brook University with a B.S. in Information Systems**, and over the years, Iâ€™ve built web and mobile apps, explored different tech stacks, and recently, started working on my own AI-powered project, **SAI**.

## **Why Start a Blog?**

Iâ€™ve always been someone who loves learning and experimenting, but I never really took the time to document my journey. With this blog, I want to change that. This space will be a mix of:

- ðŸ’¡ **Tech & Projects** â€“ Sharing insights on my personal projects, coding challenges, and lessons learned.
- ðŸ“Œ **Career & Growth** â€“ Documenting my journey in tech, job hunting, and everything in between.
- ðŸ§  **Self-Improvement** â€“ Talking about productivity, habits, and building a fulfilling life.
- ðŸ’» **Behind the Scenes** â€“ A deeper look into my creative process for both tech and content creation.

## **Where I Am Right Now**

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on **job hunting**, working on **SAI**, and continuing to build and refine my projects. At the same time, Iâ€™m growing my online presenceâ€”a journey that has been both exciting and challenging.

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**

This blog will evolve over time, but my goal is to make it **a valuable and relatable space** for fellow developers, creators, and anyone whoâ€™s on their own self-improvement journey. Iâ€™ll be sharing updates on my projects, coding tips, thoughts on life and work, and maybe even some fun behind-the-scenes content.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, **stick around!** Iâ€™d love for this blog to be a two-way conversation, so feel free to send me questions, or even suggest topics youâ€™d like me to cover.

Thanks for being hereâ€”excited for whatâ€™s ahead! ðŸŽ‰
