# **Why I Built Dooble – A Simple Web App to Help You Get Creative** ✏️

Hey friends! I’m super excited to share my latest project: **Dooble**, a fun and simple drawing web app that gives you a daily prompt to help spark your creativity. It’s perfect for when you’re feeling stuck or just want to doodle for fun. Honestly, this app came from a personal need of mine, and I think a lot of you might relate to it.

## **The Reason I Built Dooble**

I love drawing, but here’s the problem: I often don’t know what to draw. I sit there staring at a blank page, thinking, “What now?” We’ve all been there, right? You want to create something, but you just don’t have the inspiration. So I thought, why not build a tool that helps me and others get past that?

And that’s how **Dooble** was born—a simple app that gives you a new drawing prompt every day. It’s my way of breaking through creative blocks and making sure I’m always drawing, even when I don’t have the perfect idea.

But that’s not all! I also wanted to learn something new while building this. I had never worked with the **HTML5 canvas element** before, so I decided to dive in and learn it by building something fun and useful. It was the perfect opportunity to grow and challenge myself.

## **The Journey: Struggles, AI, and Finding Motivation**

Like any project, things weren’t all smooth sailing. I started developing **Dooble** on my own, but as time went on, I started to lose motivation. You know how it goes—you get excited about an idea, start working on it, but then the initial hype fades, and things get harder. I hit a point where I felt stuck, and I thought, “How can I bring this vision to life faster?”

That’s when I decided to experiment with **AI**. I started using an AI code editor called **Cursor**. At first, it was a game-changer! The AI wrote code for me super quickly, helping me speed up the process. But soon, I realized that just relying on AI wasn’t the answer. It was helpful, but it also started removing things I wanted to keep, and the visual changes weren’t always what I expected.

That’s when I had a realization: AI can be a great assistant, but it’s not here to replace you. It can help you **accelerate your progress**, but it’s not the one doing the creating—you are. Sometimes, when you get too caught up in using tools to build for you, things can become a big jumble. It’s all about balance. **AI should assist you, not take over.**

## **What Dooble Is All About**

Dooble is simple—really simple—and that’s the whole point. I wanted to create something that helped me and anyone else get their creative juices flowing every day. You don’t need to be a professional artist to enjoy it—just someone who wants to express themselves, no matter how small or big the creation is.

## **Tech Stack**

Keeping it simple was key. Here’s the tech stack I used to build Dooble:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Canvas Drawing**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## **Why Dooble Matters (to Me and Hopefully to You)**

Dooble isn’t just about building an app—it’s about **getting out of your head** and creating something. I built this because I wanted a way to make drawing accessible, even on days when I didn’t feel inspired. It’s not about making a perfect masterpiece every time—it’s about **expressing yourself, even if it’s just a quick sketch**.

The whole experience of building Dooble was also a journey in itself. It taught me a lot about **self-motivation**, **persistence**, and the **balance of using tools** (like AI) while still staying true to the creative process. And most importantly, I learned that it’s okay not to know everything right away—what matters is showing up, trying, and learning along the way.
