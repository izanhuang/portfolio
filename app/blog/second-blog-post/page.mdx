# **Building Projects That Actually Teach You Something**

One of the best ways to level up as a developer is by **building projects**—but not just any projects. The key is to build projects that **challenge you, push you out of your comfort zone, and teach you something new.**

## **Why Project-Based Learning Works**

Tutorials are great, but they often **hold your hand too much**. When you build something on your own, you’re forced to **think critically, debug issues, and make decisions**—just like in a real-world dev environment. That’s when real learning happens.

For me, each project I’ve built has been an opportunity to explore **new technologies, frameworks, and problem-solving approaches**. Here’s how I approach project-based learning:

## **1️⃣ Pick a Concept That Interests You**

If you’re not excited about what you’re building, you’re not going to stay motivated. Choose something that aligns with your interests or solves a problem you care about.

For example:

- 📝 **SAI** – I wanted to experiment with AI and self-improvement, so I built an AI-powered advice web app.
- 🎬 **Movie Finder** – I wanted to work with an external API and UI design, so I created a movie search app with OMDb API.
- 🔥 **Facebook Clone** – I wanted to learn more about **Firebase authentication, NoSQL databases, and real-time updates**, so I built a social media app.

## **2️⃣ Choose Technologies That Push You**

It’s easy to default to what you already know, but growth happens when you **explore unfamiliar territory**. For example:

- When I wanted to learn **Jetpack Compose**, I built a **Pokédex app** in Kotlin.
- When I wanted to try a **serverless backend**, I built an **e-commerce site using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.**

Don’t be afraid to pick up a new framework, database, or tool while working on a project.

## **3️⃣ Make It Functional, Then Polish It**

Start by getting the **core features working** before worrying about details like UI design. Once it works, then refine it:  
✅ Improve the UI with better styling  
✅ Optimize performance (lazy loading, caching, etc.)  
✅ Add features like dark mode, animations, and better UX

## **4️⃣ Deploy & Share Your Work**

One of the biggest mistakes devs make is **keeping projects hidden on their local machine**. Deploy it, even if it’s not perfect. Share it on GitHub, put it in your portfolio, and maybe even write a blog post about what you learned (_like this one!_).

## **Final Thoughts**

You don’t need to build the next big startup—just focus on **projects that challenge you and help you grow.** Over time, you’ll gain confidence, build a strong portfolio, and develop skills that actually matter.

What’s a project you’ve worked on that pushed you to learn something new?
